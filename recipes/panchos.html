    <h2>Recipe</h2>

    <p>After the boom of hamburgers and hamburger joints, it is now time for hot dogs, a food as noble as it is versatile. <strong>The pancho is now treated with respect, care and reversion to transform that simple sausage in a vienna bread into a complete and complex meal.</strong></p>


    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Vienna sausages</li>
        <li>Bread for pancho</li>
        <li>Coarse salt</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Optional toppings</li>
    
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>In a pot we put the handful of salt. Add half of the water and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>While the water is boiling, cut the bread in half. It is important not to throw the bags away. </li>
        <li>Once boiling, place the sausages in the water.</li>
        <li>We wait approximately 3 minutes and remove the sausages and place them in the buns. </li>
        
    </ol>
